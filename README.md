# Course: 

**INDE-577**: Data Science and Machine Learning (Rice University)

**Instructor**: Dr. Randy Davila

**Course Description**: 

This data science course covers algorithms from supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. We will implement many of the machine learning algorithms from scratch in python, but will also make use of, Scikit-Learn, Keras, and Tensorflow. ChatGPT is also a special focus of this semester.
**Textbook**:

* (Required) Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition, by Aurélien Géron
* (Recommended Supplemental Reading) Machine Learning with Python for Everyone, Addison Wesley Data & Analytics Series, 2020 Pearson Education, by Mark E. Fenner


# Introduction to Data Science and Machine Learning repository

## What is Data Science?

Data Science is a field that involves the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data. It combines elements of `statistics`, `computer science`, and `domain expertise` to extract insights and knowledge from data. Data scientists use a variety of tools and techniques to work with data, including programming languages, data visualization tools, and machine learning algorithms.

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that involves building algorithms that can learn from data. These algorithms are designed to **automatically** improve their performance on a specific task through experience. Machine Learning can be used for a wide range of applications, including image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics.

## Why is Data Science and Machine Learning Important?

Data Science and Machine Learning are becoming increasingly important as organizations seek to leverage the value of their data. By analyzing and interpreting data, businesses can gain insights that help them make better decisions, improve operations, and create new products and services. Machine Learning is particularly valuable because it can enable organizations to automate processes and make predictions that were previously difficult or impossible to make.
