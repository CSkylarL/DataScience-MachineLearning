# Lung Cancer

The Lung Cancer dataset consists of immune marker gene expressions of 58 patients having Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Each patient has paired normal and primary tumors. I generated this dataset from the original dataset available at [Broad Institute's Genome Data Analysis Center (GDAC)  Firehose](https://gdac.broadinstitute.org/). This dataset is useful for binary classification, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction tasks.

This folder contains the following files:
- Data
    - [RSEM_gene_expression](./RSEM_gene_expression.csv): The gene expression data in `.csv` format.
    - [labels](./labels.csv): The labels of the data in `.csv` format.
- [Data Description](./lung_cancer.ipynb): A Jupyter notebook providing comprehensive details about the background, creation process, and distinct characteristics of the data.
