# Breast Cancer

The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass, useful for binary classification problems.

This folder contains the following files:
- [Data](./breast_cancer.csv): The dataset in `.csv` format.
- [Data Description](./breast_cancer.ipynb): A Jupyter notebook providing comprehensive details about the background, creation process, and distinct characteristics of the data.
