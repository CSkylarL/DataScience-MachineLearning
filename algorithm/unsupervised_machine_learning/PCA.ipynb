    "## History\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure and dimensionality reduction technique that has been extensively applied in various fields of machine learning and data analysis. Introduced by Karl Pearson in 1901 and later extended by Harold Hotelling in 1933, PCA plays a crucial role in preprocessing high-dimensional data, visualizing complex data structures, and reducing noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea of PCA is to project the data onto a lower-dimensional space, such that the greatest possible amount of variance in the data is preserved. Initially, PCA was developed as a transformation method to convert observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of linearly uncorrelated variables known as principal components. This transformation is valuable as it often reveals internal structure in the data that was not immediately apparent in the high-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, PCA is an efficient tool that helps deal with high-dimensionality in datasets, making it easier to extract important information while minimizing information loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Foundations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Foundations of PCA\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA is based on linear algebra and specifically on the operation of eigen decomposition or singular value decomposition of a matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given a $d$-dimensional dataset, the goal is to find a $k$-dimensional subspace (where $k<d$) that captures the most variance in the data. This is done by projecting the original data points onto this subspace. \n",
    "\n",
    "The $k$ dimensions (or axes) of this subspace are vectors called principal components. These are found by solving the following optimization problem (variance maximization problem):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\max_{\\mathbf{w}} \\: \\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{S} \\mathbf{w} \\quad \\text{s.t.} \\quad \\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{w} = 1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{w}$ is the weight vector that we are trying to find. This vector will become the principal component.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{S}$ is the sample covariance matrix of the data. The covariance matrix provides a measure of how much each of the dimensions/variances of the input dataset 'vary together', which is calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\mathbf{S} = \\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (\\mathbf{x}_i - \\bar{\\mathbf{x}})(\\mathbf{x}_i - \\bar{\\mathbf{x}})^T\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "    where:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - $N$ is the number of samples in the dataset.\n",
    "    - $\\mathbf{x}_i$ represents each individual data point in the dataset.\n",
    "    - $\\bar{\\mathbf{x}}$ is the mean vector of the dataset, calculated as $\\bar{\\mathbf{x}} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathbf{x}_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The covariance matrix $\\mathbf{S}$ is a $d \\times d$ matrix (where $d$ is the number of dimensions/features in your data), and each element $S_{ij} = \\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} (x_{ni} - \\bar{x}_i)(x_{nj} - \\bar{x}_j)$ in this matrix is the covariance between the $i^{th}$ and $j^{th}$ dimensions of the data. The diagonal elements of the covariance matrix ($S_{ii}$) are the variances of individual dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{S} \\mathbf{w}$ is the variance of the data along the direction of $\\mathbf{w}$. We want to maximize this variance, as we're seeking the direction (or principal component) that retains the maximum possible information from the original data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The condition $\\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{w} = 1$ is a constraint that ensures that $\\mathbf{w}$ is a unit vector (i.e., its length is 1). This prevents trivial solutions, such as increasing the length of $\\mathbf{w}$ to artificially inflate the variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The principal components are ordered by their corresponding `eigenvalues` which represent the amount of variance captured by each principal component. Thus, the first principal component is the direction in the data that captures the most variance, the second principal component (which is orthogonal to the first) captures the second most variance, and so on. We compute the eigenvalues ($\\lambda$) and eigenvectors ($\\mathbf{v}$) of the sample covariance matrix ($\\mathbf{S}$), which satisfy the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{S}\\mathbf{v} = \\lambda\\mathbf{v}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, the eigenvalues represent the variance (information) along the new feature axes, while the eigenvectors represent the directions of these new axes. The eigenvector $\\mathbf{v}$ must be non-zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning algorithm for PCA consists of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Standardize the dataset (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1) to ensure equal importance of all features.\n",
    "2. Calculate the covariance matrix of the standardized dataset.\n",
    "3. Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix.\n",
    "4. Sort the eigenvalues in descending order and select the top k eigenvectors.\n",
    "5. Project the original data onto the lower-dimensional space spanned by the top k eigenvectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Define the PCA class\n",
    "### Showcase the above PCA Class in iris dataset\n",
    "### Use the PCA class provided by Scikit-Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "###\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pros and Cons\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- Reduces the dimensionality of the data, which can help overcome the curse of dimensionality and improve the performance of machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "- Can help visualize high-dimensional data.\n",
    "- Removes multicollinearity between features and improves interpretability of the results.\n",
    "- Can be used for noise reduction in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- Assumes that the principal components are linear combinations of the original features.\n",
    "- Loss of information due to the reduction in dimensionality.\n",
    "- Sensitive to the scaling of the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Suitable Tasks and Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "PPCA is suitable for a wide variety of tasks and datasets. Here are a few examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preprocessing**: PCA can be used as a preprocessing step in machine learning pipelines to reduce the dimensionality of the data. This can help mitigate the curse of dimensionality and reduce the risk of overfitting. This is particularly useful for datasets with a large number of features, i.e., high-dimensional datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Noise Reduction**: PCA can be used to denoise data by projecting it onto a lower-dimensional space, which can effectively reduce the effect of noise variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Visualization**: PCA can be used to visualize high-dimensional data by projecting it onto a 2 or 3-dimensional space. This is helpful for datasets where it's important to understand the structure and relationships in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Anomaly Detection**: In some cases, outliers or anomalies will become more apparent when visualized in the lower-dimensional space created by PCA.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data Compression**: PCA can be used to compress data, reducing its storage requirements and speeding up learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Feature Extraction**: PCA can also be used for feature extraction. By transforming the original variables to a new set of variables, which are the principal components, PCA can extract the most important information from the dataset. These new variables are linear combinations of the original variables and can sometimes be more interpretable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common datasets where PCA might be used include image datasets, text datasets (after converting the text into a set of numerical features), gene expression and any dataset with a large number of features. However, PCA assumes a linear relationship among variables. If this assumption is violated, the results may not be reliable.\n",
