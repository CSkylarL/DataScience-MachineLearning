# Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where a model learns to make predictions based on a set of labeled examples. In supervised learning, the model is provided with a dataset where the correct answers, or labels, are known. The task of the model is to learn the mapping function from the input features to the output label. The learning process continues until the model achieves a desired level of accuracy on the training data.

Supervised learning is widely used in various fields including image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, and more. There are two main types of tasks in supervised learning: classification and regression. 

## Classification

Classification is a type of supervised learning task where the output variable is a category, or a discrete label. In other words, the model classifies input instances into one of the predefined classes. Classification tasks can be binary (two classes) or multiclass (more than two classes). This repository contains examples and explanations of various classification algorithms, including:

- [**Perceptron**](./perceptron.ipynb): The perceptron is a linear binary classification algorithm that is used to classify data into two classes. It is a single-layer neural network that takes in a set of input features and produces a single output value.
- [**Logistic Regression**](./logistic_regression.ipynb): Logistic regression is a classification algorithm that is used to predict the probability of a categorical dependent variable. It is a linear model that uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable.
- [**Decision Trees**](./decision_tree.ipynb): Decision trees are a type of supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. They learn a series of hierarchical if/else questions to classify data points.
- [**k-Nearest Neighbors**](./KNN.ipynb): k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) is a classification algorithm that is used to classify data points based on their proximity to other data points. It is a non-parametric algorithm that does not make any assumptions about the underlying data distribution.
- [**Random Forests**](./random_forest.ipynb): Random forests are an ensemble learning method that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. They are a collection of decision trees that are trained on different subsets of the training data. The final prediction is made by aggregating the predictions of the individual trees.
- [**Dense Neural Networks**](./DNN.ipynb): Dense neural networks are a type of artificial neural network that is used for both classification and regression tasks. They are composed of multiple layers of neurons that are densely connected to each other. Each neuron in a layer is connected to every neuron in the previous layer.


## Regression

Regression, on the other hand, is a type of supervised learning task where the output variable is a real or continuous value. The model predicts a numerical value based on input features.

A common example of a regression task is predicting the price of a house based on features like its size, location, number of rooms, etc. The output is a single continuous value that represents the predicted price.

Like classification, various algorithms can be used for regression tasks. This repository contains examples and explanations of various regression algorithms as follows:
- [**Linear Regression**](./linear_regression.ipynb): Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm that is used to predict a continuous output variable based on one or more input features. It is a linear model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables and the output variable.
- [**Decision Trees**](./decision_tree.ipynb): Decision trees are a type of supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. They learn a series of hierarchical if/else questions to classify data points.
- [**Random Forests**](./random_forest.ipynb): Random forests are an ensemble learning method that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. They are a collection of decision trees that are trained on different subsets of the training data. The final prediction is made by aggregating the predictions of the individual trees.
- [**Dense Neural Networks**](./DNN.ipynb): Dense neural networks are a type of artificial neural network that is used for both classification and regression tasks. They are composed of multiple layers of neurons that are densely connected to each other. Each neuron in a layer is connected to every neuron in the previous layer.

## Ensemble Learning

Ensemble learning is a technique in machine learning that combines multiple models, or base learners, to improve the overall predictive performance. The idea behind ensemble learning is that by combining the strengths of several models, the final model will provide better results than any individual model. Ensemble learning can be applied to both classification and regression tasks.

There are several ways to combine the predictions of multiple models, including:

1. **Bagging**: Also known as bootstrap aggregating, bagging is a technique where multiple base learners are trained on different subsets of the original dataset. The subsets are created by randomly sampling the dataset with replacement. The final prediction is obtained by averaging the predictions of the base learners (for regression) or by taking a majority vote (for classification). **A popular example of bagging is the [**Random Forests**](./random_forest.ipynb), which is available in this repository.**

2. **Boosting**: Boosting is an iterative technique that adjusts the weights of the base learners based on their performance. Initially, all instances in the dataset are assigned equal weights. In each iteration, a weak learner is trained on the dataset, and the weights of the instances are updated based on the learner's performance. Instances that were misclassified get higher weights, while instances that were correctly classified get lower weights. This process continues until a stopping criterion is met. Examples of boosting algorithms include AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs).

3. **Stacking**: Stacking, or stacked generalization, involves training multiple base learners on the dataset, and then training another model, called the meta-model, on top of the base learners' predictions. The meta-model learns to combine the predictions of the base learners, taking into account their individual strengths and weaknesses. Stacking can be used with a variety of base learners and meta-models, allowing for a high degree of flexibility.

Ensemble learning has proven to be very effective in various machine learning tasks, often outperforming single-model approaches. By leveraging the strengths of multiple models, ensemble learning reduces the risk of overfitting, provides better generalization, and ultimately leads to more accurate and robust predictions.
