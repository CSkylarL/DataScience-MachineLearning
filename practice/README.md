# practice

This folder contains projects and practices of data science and machine learning.

1. [Stroke Prediction](./P01_Stroke_Prediction.ipynb)
    - **Data**: [Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset). Please refer to the corresponding[data notebook](../../data/stroke/stroke.ipynb) for more information about the [dataset](../../data/stroke/healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv).
    - **Objective**:
        1. Predict whether a patient is likely to have a stroke based on the given features.
        2. Learn how to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing and machine learning modeling
        3. Compare the performance of different machine learning models
        4. Compare the performance using all features and using selected features
    - **Models**: 
        - Perceptron
        - Logistic Regression
        - Decision Tree
        - Random Forest
        - AdaBoost
        - Support Vector Machine
        - K-Nearest Neighbors
        - Multi-layer Perceptron
        - Gaussian Naive Bayes.
